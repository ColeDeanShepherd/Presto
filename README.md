# Presto
A programming language.

## Ideas
* Easy deep copy
* Macros for control flow (ex: do something, if error then return).
    * Can be done with monads (clunky).
* Discriminated unions
    * Source generators?
* Concurrency with green threads - solve function coloring problem.
* Less verbose mutable class definition syntax.
    * C# actually already has this - mutable records.
* Functions outside of classes.
    * can be done with "using static CLASS_NAME;"
* Type aliases
* Immutable freezing
* Immutable by default
* Exhaustive pattern matching
